The workflow is based on the "[Better IMDB Search](http://www.packal.org/workflow/better-imdb-search)" workflow by frankspin. It uses the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

Movie Ratings uses a single command:

`mr [query]`: Looks up a movie matching the query.

Using the copy shortcut will copy the movie's IMDb URL and clicking **Enter** will open the movie's IMDb page.
